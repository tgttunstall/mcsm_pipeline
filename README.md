# mcsm_pipeline

A first stab at a pipeline to run mcsm on a list of mutations using a combination of bash, R and python.

The scripts are labelled in the order they need to be executed, however please note that the formatting of of the results are tailored towards pnca-pza complex. 

The mcsm output format might vary depending on the drug-target complex (i.e extra info for certain runs).
